# 🚲 Bike Sharing Demand - Case Study

This project analyzes a bike-sharing dataset to understand user behavior and predict demand. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and regression modeling, we aim to identify key variables that influence the number of bikes rented in a given day.

## 🧾 Problem Statement

Bike-sharing systems are a rapidly growing mode of urban transportation. Accurately forecasting bike demand helps companies optimize their operations, reduce costs, and improve user experience.

This case study focuses on a dataset containing daily records of bike rentals. The objective is to explore patterns in the data and build a regression model to **predict the number of bikes rented** based on various features like weather, time, and seasonality.
